    Throughout my time at The Ohio State University, I explored a diverse subject matter and work with many incredible people. 
    I learned  many technical skills and techniques while working on fun and interesting projects. 
    Some projects included CTFs in information security,  basic image detection programs in AI, and a fitness dashboard in web applications.
    
    While at Ohio State, I also had the privilege to be a part of the first class of the [Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program](https://u.osu.edu/ibeprogram/program/about/).
    This is a four year program that is designed to develop the ability to communicate across business and technical domains by bringing together incredible students from many different backgrounds.
