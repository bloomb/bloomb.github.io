    Throughout my time at The Ohio State University, I was to explore diverse subject matter and work with very incredible people. 
    I was able to learn many technical skills. This includes a love of security through CTFs in my information security classes, a brief introduction to AI by creating algorithms for basic image detection, and building a fitness web in my web application course.
    
    While at Ohio State, I also had the privilege to be a member of the first class of the <mark>Integrated Business and Engineering Honors Program.</mark>
