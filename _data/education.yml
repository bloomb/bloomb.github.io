    Throughout my time at The Ohio State University, I was to explore diverse subject matter and work with incredible people. 
    I was able explore many technical skills and techniques working on fun and intresting projects. 
    This projects included working on CTFs in my information security classes, crating a basic image detection program in AI, and building a fitness dashboard in my web application course.
