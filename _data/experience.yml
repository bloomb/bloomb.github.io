    When I first join Magellan Health, I was worked on <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>native iOS</mark>. I was responsible for creating a backend for a mobile application using serverless technologies. 
    This was my first major introduction to AWS and the world of serverless. While I was learning and building a serverless backend, I also was assisting in the development of the front end
    iOS application.

    After a while, I was transfered to the AWS Cloud Infrastructure team at Magellan Health. Currently, I help manage Magellan Health's AWS accounts by helping build a centralized account
    managing system using ansible and cloudformation.
