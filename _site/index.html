      <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p>When I first join Magellan Health, I was worked on <mark>AWS</mark> and <mark>native iOS</mark>. I was responsible for creating a backend for a mobile application using serverless technologies. 
This was my first major introduction to AWS and the world of serverless. While I was learning and building a serverless backend, I also was assisting in the development of the front end
iOS application.</p>

<p>After a while, I was transfered to the AWS Cloud Infrastructure team at Magellan Health. Currently, I help manage Magellan Health’s AWS accounts by helping build a centralized account
managing system using ansible and cloudformation.</p>

  <h3>Life Outside the Code</h3>
  <div class="row clearfix">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <p>While coding and developing software are a major passions of mine, I do like to get out and explore other things. 
When not on a computer, I enjoy running and working out. I feel that staying active is helps me maintain my sanity when squashing bugs in code.
I also consider myself a little bit of a sneakerhead. I am always on the lookout for the newest and greatest shoe release.</p>
